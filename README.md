Scrappy
=======

A simple utility to help scrap things and save them


**Warning** : work in progress, it's not fully functional yet !

## Functionnalities

- easy click and select elements on page
- use jQuery selectors
- smart actions for elements (detects a, img, p, table) and offers custom actions for these
- smart pagination links handling
- detects attributes and offers to scrap them
- CRUD scrapping projects (use localStorage at the moment)
