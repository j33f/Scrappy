Scrappy
=======

A simple utility to help scrap things and save them


**Warning** : work in progress, it's not fully functional yet !

## Functionnalities

- easy click and select elements on page
- use jQuery selectors
- smart actions for elements (detects a, img, p, table) and offers custom actions for these
- smart pagination links handling
- detects attributes and offers to scrap them
- CRUD scrapping projects (use localStorage at the moment)

## Try it now

or try the demo (may not be up to date) http://scrappy-example.herokuapp.com

## Ideas reminder 

- handle the colspan for tables
- maybe handle the rowspan
- maybe add a way to reconstruct the full URIs for href and src
