Scrappy
=======

A simple utility to help scrap things and save them

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/j33f/Scrappy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/j33f/Scrappy)

**Warning** : work in progress, it's not fully functional yet even if build status is ok !

## Functionnalities

- easy click and select elements on page
- use jQuery selectors
- smart actions for elements (detects a, img, p, table) and offers custom actions for these
- smart pagination links handling
- detects attributes and offers to scrap them
- CRUD scrapping projects (use localStorage at the moment)
- export data to JSON, CSV or ZIP of CSV files

## Try it now
